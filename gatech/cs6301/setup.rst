Setup Instructions
==================

The class uses virtual machine to setup the development environment


* `Software Setup Instructions`_
* `VirtualBox 5.0.20 for OS X hosts`_ - I used this as my host was a Mac
* `Virtual Machine Image`_

Installing Virtual Box Guest Additions. This will provide a better experience when working with Virtualbox.

::

    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11


This was sufficient to setup my fullscreen mode.

I was also able to mount the `Virtualbox Guest Additions ISO`_ using the Virtualbox mount cd facility and install the
guest additions. Both will work.

Writing Guidelines
------------------

Technical Format

The most important thing to do in any document is to show that you have thought about the topic and gained some understanding, but grading also takes technical format into account.

* All written documents must be prepared using a word processor.
* Each document should be double-spaced using a Times 12 point font with margins of 1.25" left and right and 1" top and bottom. You may use other fonts, such as New Courier, for specific purposes, such as indicating code, as long as they are 12 point.
* Each document should clearly identify its author(s), date, and relevant assignment or project.
* If a document includes material from an outside source, a proper citation (author, title, publication name, date, and page number or URL) must be included in the document.
* All written work should be submitted using the PDF format.
