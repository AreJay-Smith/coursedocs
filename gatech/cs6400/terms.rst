* Minimal Cover

Informally, a minimal cover of a set of functional dependencies E is a set of functional dependencies F that satisfies
the property that every dependency in E is in the closure F+ of F. In addition, this property is lost if any dependency
from the set F is removed; F must have no redundancies in it, and the dependencies in F are in a standard form.
