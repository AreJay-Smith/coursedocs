Berkeley
--------

The AI videos/slides at Berkeley are very good, especially on the topic of Reinforcement learning.  Look for the lectures on MDPs and RL and test your knowledge with the "pacman" agents and the robot crawler (my favorite):

Also, here are some useful materials for Deep Learning at Stanford.  I highly recommend the first sections in Module 1 where they compare k-NN to Neural Networks and all of Module 3 on Convolutional Networks.  The NLP content I have less specific pointers in at the moment.
