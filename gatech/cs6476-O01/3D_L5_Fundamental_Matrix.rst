Fundamental Matrix
==================

Fundamental Matrix
Epipolar Lines.
Epipoles
Function of the depth.
Each point correspondence generates one constraint on F.
The "eight-point algorithm"
SVD.
Epipolar Lines.
Homography
The line l' be the epipolar line corresponding to p'.
Homography

l' = e' x p'
   = e' x H_pi p
   = [e']_x H_pi p


Fix the Linear Solution

F = UDV^T

For 2-views, there is a geometric relationship that defines the relation between rays in one vieqw to rays in
other - epipolar geometry.

These relationships can be captured algebraically as well.
