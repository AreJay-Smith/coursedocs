C Programming Coding Conventions
--------------------------------

* Always use typedef with the structure declaration.

* Pointer declaration of * goes with the type, behind the type. It should `int*` , `char*`, `StructureType*`

* `&` goes with the variable.

* qualifier const goes ahead of the type.

* `sizeof` use without the brackets.
