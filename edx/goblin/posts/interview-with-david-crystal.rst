David Crystal is linguist and shares concern on grammar not being taught in
school these days.

His prediction is English will become a diglossic language

In linguistics, diglossia refers to a situation in which two dialects or
languages are used by a single language community. Like folks in Singapore
talking both Singlish and learning to write proper English in school.
