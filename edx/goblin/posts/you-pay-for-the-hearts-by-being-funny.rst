"You pay for the hearts by being funny is the message that is shared by this
"writer of the australian blog_. He recollects that Star Wars impressed him and
many not because was an advanced movie, but it had unsophisticated laughs by all
the characters in the movie.

Many of the movies that I enjoyed and have stayed close to my heart are due
comedy in them. All my favorite Kamal Hassan movies come to this.
