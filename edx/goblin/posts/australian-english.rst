Macquire Dictionary is the Australian dictionary which lists the common words
that Australian's have come to use in their daily lives. It gave legitimacy to
their vocabulary and Australians started to feel the distinction for the words
they use.

This article led to me to think that Singlish could benefit by having a
recognized dictionary. It will make the lives of Singaporeans all the more
better as they happily use the Singlish lah.

On the words itself, muffin top was amusing as I see a lot of muffin tops while
travelling in San Franciscio.

The other usage of "Between you and I" vs "Between you and me" was interesting
as I often correct myself to write "I" based on what I learnt from a grammar
book, while this article states that wrting "Between you and me" is
grammatically correct. Looks like I have to keep updating myself on grammar.


Author calls herself a descriptivist, a person who notes how the language is
used rather than dictating the strong rules on how the language should be used.
