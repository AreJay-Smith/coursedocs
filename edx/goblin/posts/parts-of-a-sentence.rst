How can we enumerate and remember the parts of the sentence. The technical terms given to them
seem to cause certain fear in a new learner. The parts of the sentence seem too dull or
mechanical and sometimes not useful. I will try to make those parts easy to remember and
emphasize on the usefulness of the parts.

A Noun is a word about a person or an object. It is countable, you can visualize it, imagine a
shape and structure for it. Ram is a noun, a chair is a noun, and as you read the sentence, your
mind works to form an image for the noun.

A Pronoun, links to another Noun and you can form a picture if you followed the link. In the
sentence, "They came to my house.", they refers to a pronoun. You can form an image of a group of
friends, if you associate, whom "they" refers to in the sentence.

A Verb does things. It is the most exciting part of any sentence, all the action happens through
the verb.

An adverb, describes the verb, that's like an extra booster to the verb.

An adjective, decorates the noun so that readers can form a vivid picture of the noun.

Conjunction are joiner sentences, they are used to join two or more sentences together.

An article, describes something. Words like "a", "the" are articles.

Interjection, shows emotions and expresses surprise.
