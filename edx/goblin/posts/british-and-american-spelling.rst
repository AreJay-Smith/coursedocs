British and Americans have `different spellings`_ for many words. I come to know
that britis adopted those spelling when they borrowed the words from other
languages, while americans use the word as they spell it. Like 'color' vs
'colour' and 'neighbor' vs 'neighbour'.

For someone like me, who grew up India where British english is followed, I have
some difficulty in choosing the correct spelling.  But most often, by reading
articles written in America and using my software location settings, I will be
able to write using the regional spellings, that is using American English.
