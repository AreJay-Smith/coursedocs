This news article_ describes how walking assists in thinking. I can realize that
they are talking about the diffused mode of thinking which is required for
creative problem solving. It also mentions that walking while requiring focussed
attention for some types of problems could be counter productive.

The other important point emphasised was how attention is scarce resource and
how it should be conserved.
