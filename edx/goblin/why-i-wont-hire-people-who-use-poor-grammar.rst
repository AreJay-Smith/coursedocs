The author of the article_ is managing a business that writes instructional
manuals. She emphasizes that good grammar is important for anyone in the
business and more so for programmars.

I agree with the programars part, we write english more often than we write
code. Caring for details matter a lot in my work and that's what differentiate's
good programmars from bad ones. Using good english is a requirement for a
programmar.

The part she quotes Knuth stating that "programmars are essayists who work with
traditional aesthetic and literary forms‚Äù  striked me the most, because it is
coming from an established person who cares about this field.

A very good programmar at my workspace is excellent at English language usage
and Grammar. Even the CEO looked up to him and called him, if he made any
mistakes in the speech.
