Discrete Cosine Transform
Mean Square Error. = Mean Square Error.
MSG = 1/ (number of pixels) * Sum(F^_ - F)^2

Discrete Cosine Transform
Fourier Transform
Transform is useful when you can invert it.
DCT
alpha(u) = sqrt(1/n) u = 0 | sqrt(2/n) u != 0
T(u, v)
T(3, 3)
Discrete Cosine Transform
n = 4
Cheaper to multiple small DCTs than large DCTs.
Quantization.
