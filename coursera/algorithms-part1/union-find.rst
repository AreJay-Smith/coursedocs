**Percolation**

Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the
materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with
water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or
the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such
situations.

Programming assignment gives an opportunity to apply the concepts of Union-Find to a fundamental problem in physical
chemistry.

It is the first of many examples where a good algorithm, weighted quick union, makes the difference between being able
to efficiently solve a problem and not being able to address it at all.
